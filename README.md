## We're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:

General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions. 

Conversation history: You’ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don’t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.

Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you’re included in this group, you’ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT. 

To see if you’re using the updated version, look for “ChatGPT Dec 15 Version” at the bottom of the screen.
